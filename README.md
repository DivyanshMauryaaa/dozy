  <h1>🌙 Dozy</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Productivity, but chill.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Dozy</strong> is a cozy, minimal productivity app made for people who want to get things done 
    without the pressure of traditional Type-A, hustle-culture productivity tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s designed especially for students—high schoolers and college-goers—who struggle with procrastination, 
    distractions, and overwhelming task lists. Think of it as a todo-list meets your mood.
  </p>

  <h2>✨ Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 AI-based smart task suggestions</li>
    <li>🌈 Mood-based UI themes</li>
    <li>💬 Chill collaboration for group projects</li>
    <li>🔄 Simple sync across devices</li>
    <li>🛌 "I feel lazy" mode for gentle productivity</li>

  <h2>🎯 Why Dozy?</h2>
  <p>
    Most productivity apps are made for hardcore, Type-A users. They're overwhelming, filled with features 
    you never use, and often feel like more work. Dozy is different. It's soft, warm, human.
  </p>
  <p>
    Made for the distracted student, the casual creator, and the daydreamer who wants to do better—just 
    without the burnout.
